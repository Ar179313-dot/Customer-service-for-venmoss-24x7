            <h2>Our Premium Car Wash Services</h2>
            <p>At Peter's Professional Car Wash in Lake Jackson, TX, we offer comprehensive car wash services designed to keep your vehicle looking its best. Our basic wash includes a thorough exterior clean with premium shampoos that protect your paint while removing dirt and grime. We pay special attention to wheels and tires, using specialized cleaners to remove brake dust and road tar. For interiors, we vacuum all surfaces, clean door jambs, and wipe down dashboards. Our deluxe package includes hand drying to prevent water spots, tire dressing for a like-new shine, and interior window cleaning. We use only pH-balanced soaps and premium microfiber towels to ensure no scratches or swirl marks are introduced to your vehicle's finish. Regular washing at our facility not only maintains your car's appearance but also protects its resale value by preventing long-term damage from road salt, bird droppings, and environmental contaminants.</p>
            
            <p>For customers seeking deeper cleaning, we offer clay bar treatment that removes embedded contaminants regular washing can't touch. This service prepares your vehicle for waxing or sealing by creating an ultra-smooth surface. Our premium wash packages include undercarriage cleaning to remove corrosive road salts, especially important for Texas coastal vehicles. We also provide engine bay cleaning using low-pressure steam and degreasers that safely remove oil and grime without damaging sensitive components. For convertible owners, we offer specialized top cleaning and conditioning to preserve your soft top material. Our team is trained to work on all vehicle types, from compact cars to full-size trucks and SUVs, adjusting our techniques to each vehicle's specific needs. We recommend bi-weekly washes for optimal protection and appearance maintenance.</p>

            <h2>Professional Detailing Services</h2>
            <p>Peter's Professional Car Wash goes beyond basic cleaning with our detailing services that restore your vehicle to showroom condition. Our interior detailing begins with complete vacuuming using industrial-strength equipment that removes dirt from deep within carpets and upholstery. We shampoo all fabric surfaces and leather seats (with appropriate conditioners for leather), clean and condition all vinyl and plastic surfaces, and meticulously clean air vents and other hard-to-reach areas. For heavily soiled vehicles, we offer odor elimination treatments that use ozone machines to permanently remove smoke, pet, or food odors. Our exterior detailing includes paint decontamination, thorough polishing to remove light scratches and swirl marks, and application of premium wax or ceramic coatings that provide long-lasting protection.</p>
            
            <p>For collectors and enthusiasts, we provide concours-level detailing that can take 20-40 hours per vehicle, including paint correction to remove all imperfections, complete engine compartment detailing, and jambs cleaning. We also offer specialized services like headlight restoration that removes yellowing and haze to improve both appearance and nighttime visibility. Our pet hair removal system is unmatched in the Lake Jackson area, using specialized tools to completely extract hair from upholstery. For families with young children, we provide complete car seat cleaning and sanitization. We use eco-friendly products whenever possible, ensuring a safe environment for both our technicians and your family. Regular detailing not only maintains your vehicle's appearance but can significantly extend the life of interior materials and exterior finishes.</p>

            <h2>Denting & Painting Expertise</h2>
            <p>When your vehicle suffers dents, scratches, or paint damage, our skilled technicians can restore it to its original condition. We specialize in paintless dent repair (PDR), a technique that massages dents out from the inside without affecting your factory paint finish. This method is ideal for door dings, hail damage, and minor creases, preserving your vehicle's original paint and avoiding the need for fillers or repainting. For larger dents that cannot be repaired with PDR, we perform traditional bodywork using high-quality fillers and primers before expertly matching and applying your vehicle's factory paint color. Our paint mixing system uses computerized color matching to ensure perfect results every time.</p>
            
            <p>Our full-service paint department handles everything from small scratch touch-ups to complete repaints. We begin each paint job with proper surface preparation, including dent removal, sanding, and priming. Our climate-controlled paint booth ensures dust-free application and proper curing for a flawless finish. We use only premium basecoat/clearcoat systems that match factory specifications for durability and appearance. For older vehicles, we offer color sanding and buffing services that can restore faded paint to like-new condition. All paint work comes with a warranty against defects, and we stand behind our workmanship. Whether you need a bumper repainted after a minor collision or want to refresh your entire vehicle's appearance, our team has the skills and equipment to deliver exceptional results that meet or exceed manufacturer standards.</p>
